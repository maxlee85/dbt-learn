This is my practice repo for dbt.

I followed the instructions [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/setting-up) using BigQuery. 

The schemas present are: 
- dbt_max: contains fct and dim tables
- dbt_max_seeds: dummy data used to build my models

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
